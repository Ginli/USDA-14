## What's our problem?
Nowaday people care about food choice and diet to keep good health.  The USDA National Nutrient Database is the standard reference for nutritional contents of food in the United States. However, it is always hard for customers to find the nutrition distribution of the food exactly and which kind of food they want based on their plan. Also comparison of nutritions among foods is more complicated. In order to solve this problem, we build a visualization system to decode the data and visualize the data sheet from USDA.
